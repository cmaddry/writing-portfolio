										<h2>About Caleb Maddry</h2>
										<p>Biography</p>
									</header>
										<p>Caleb Maddry is a student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics with minors in Biochemistry and Applied Mathematics. He will be graduating in May 2025. Following graduation, he will be traveling in Europe for 3 months and then begin work as a Systems Engineer at The MITRE Corporation. He is naturally curious and passionate about learning different topics across a wide variety of fields, from cutting-edge technologies to the intricate details of scientific research. <br><br><br><br></p>

										<h2>  </h2>
										<p>Artist Statement</p>
									</header>
									<p>Caleb has always been a lover of words. He spends hours every day listening to the kind of lyrical rap music that manipulates and bends the English language to captivate its audience. Only recently did he understand that this style of writing is just as valid as the many books he read in high school. Over the last four years, Caleb has fallen in love with writing. In high school, he used his English classes as a platform to practice stand-up comedy, but when he began to learn the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of writing in college, he fell in love with the process. There&rsquo;s a scientific method in writing too. A specific structure that guides the writer until a piece has been created. Writing is a group activity, just like problem solving on a chalk board, writing requires different contributions to generate a work. The same traits that Caleb loves about physics and engineering are the traits that made him fall in love with writing.</p>
									<p>Caleb enjoys writing about science, engineering, and economics. He is interested in understanding how these different fields come together to accomplish common goals and solve various problems. He&rsquo;s highly opinionated and isn&rsquo;t afraid to tell you what he thinks. For this reason, op-eds are his favorite writing style, although he loves to write informative pieces as well. His least favorite topic to write about? Himself. As a private and closed off person, he prefers to keep the intricate and intimate moments of his life to himself. &nbsp;</p>
									<p>After completing his degree, Caleb will be working as a Systems Engineer at The MITRE Corporation, but he plans on using his newly found love for writing in law school and eventually in his dream career as a patent lawyer. Combining his passions: engineering, physics, and of course writing, Caleb will hopefully find fulfillment in his career choice.</p>

									<h3>Arts Review</h3>
									<p style="text-align: center;">Michael</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven years of silence, interrupted by the raw and unfiltered expression of himself, Killer Mike delivers the best rap album of 2024. In a world of youth, dominated by likes of Playboi Carti, Doechii, and Jack Harlow, how did Killer Mike successfully disrupt the norm? &nbsp;</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new album by Killer Mike isn&rsquo;t something that was longed for the by the rap community. The genre left him without skipping a beat, yet <em>Michael</em> seemed to deliver something we felt lost without. The 49-year-old rapper, who launched his career in the late &rsquo;90s, working with the likes of Outkast and Jay-Z, delivers verses for friends, family, loved ones, and describes the moments that created the figure we know as Killer Mike. In intimate detail, he grants us a behind the scenes look at Michael Render, the man behind the music.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genuineness of the album feels like a breath of fresh air in a world of flexing. While he still speaks about the classic rapper elements: drugs, money, women; he approaches the subjects from a more mature standpoint. On &ldquo;YES!&rdquo;, he raps, &ldquo;I used to trap from Faron down to Camelot I used to whip up coke in my granny's pot&rdquo;, and shows his growth in the next bar, &ldquo;I went to callin' out to Jesus like a reverend, homie. / Chalked it up to sin, took it on my chin&rdquo;. Growth is a common theme on the album, from a young kid on the streets of Atlanta to becoming a social activist in the same community. He sprinkles his relationship with religion throughout the entire album. &ldquo;HIGH AND HOLY&rdquo; is a strong example of religion&rsquo;s impact on him. The song&rsquo;s chorus, sang by Ty Dolla Sign, repeats &ldquo;My life&rsquo;s a testimony, that&rsquo;s why I stay high and holy&rdquo;, further alluding to Killer Mike&rsquo;s growth while also talking about his relationship with religion. Killer Mike&rsquo;s gospel choir, The Mighty Midnight Revival, provides vocals for this song and nearly every other song on the album. While listening to the album, you can&rsquo;t help but feel the presence of the southern Baptist churches in his hometown of Atlanta.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s no surprise that an album about his life story focuses on Atlanta, the city that raised him, and contains features from CeeLo Green, Andre 3000, Young Thug, 6lack, Future, and 2 Chainz. All of whom are synonymous with the Atlanta music scene. The album&rsquo;s features, both young and old, merge well into the project. They add a brightness to the album that wouldn&rsquo;t exist with Killer Mike alone. At times, his verses feel old and dull, but the outstanding production and solid features prevent the dullness from suffocating <em>Michael&rsquo;s</em> tracks. Ty Dolla Sign performs background vocals on &ldquo;TWO DAYS&rdquo; that help break up Killer Mike&rsquo;s mid verses. El-P&rsquo;s verse on &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T LET THE DEVIL&rdquo; is tough with a ton of good bars that float over a hard hitting beat and rhythmic vocals. &ldquo;DOWN BY LAW&rdquo; and &ldquo;TALK&rsquo;N THAT SHIT!&rdquo; are two more rhyme-laden songs that illustrate Killer Mike&rsquo;s lyricism and offer the listener a reprieve from the mumble rap of today&rsquo;s genre. These hard-hitting songs are separated with the softer (and still lyrically strong) songs where we see the personal and emotional side of <em>Michael</em>.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a certified mama&rsquo;s boy, my favorite moments of the album take place when Killer Mike talks about his mom. In &ldquo;MOTHERLESS&rdquo;, you can feel the emotion and passion in his voice as he raps over the nastiest beat on the entire album. The rhythmic hi-hats, the funky bass line, and the simple piano chords come together into something that only No I.D., the producer of &ldquo;Nonstop&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bound 2&rdquo;, could create. His lyrics show the impact his mom had on him: &ldquo;I would gladly trade it all 'cause I be missin' you. / I be missin' huggin' you, I miss kissin' you. / I miss all the jewels and I miss all your wisdom too.&rdquo; He raps about the things he has accomplished and attributes them to his late mother. Sure, lots of rappers have songs dedicated to their mothers (like Kanye&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hey Mama&rdquo; or 21 Savage&rsquo;s &ldquo;letter 2 my momma&rdquo;), but none of these come close to displaying the same amount of emotion that Killer Mike gives us in this song.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;SLUMMER&rdquo;, a clever song about teenage love, explores a relationship with a girl from his youth. Michael describes a moment in his teens when he got his girlfriend pregnant and had to find money for an abortion. He rhythmically chants: &ldquo;It's the-, it's the-, it's the abortion money, gotta get it up. / It's the-, it's the-, I still feel like we still killed our baby girl&rdquo; in the first verse. The subsequent verses pivot to a storytelling perspective where he goes into more detail about his conflicted feelings in the relationship. While the song is about his personal familiarity with teen pregnancy, it is clearly hinting at how common this experience is amongst lower income communities. The song further alludes to this in the outro, where a voice speaks about unintentional teen pregnancies in &ldquo;the hood&rdquo; and hints to this negatively impacting women in the community. This extension feels well placed and I&rsquo;m sure the generalization feels relatable to some people. Killer Mike tries to generalize his experiences in several songs, and while I&rsquo;m sure this was motivated by good intentions, the album can feel preachy and hypocritical at times.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killer Mike&rsquo;s tendency to preach creeps through various places on <em>Michael</em>. In &ldquo;Down By Law&rdquo;, we see an explicit example of this as he raps: &ldquo;Listen, my n****. / Snakes in your circle and them bitches hissin', my n****. / My n**** don't listen, one thing I hate 'bout my n****. / So I just pray 'bout my n****.&rdquo; He then goes on to compare himself to Malcom X, Martin Luther King Jr., and the African American historian John Henrik Clarke. This is one of the few things about the album that I dislike. He seems to think that his eleven-year hiatus has brought him to some kind of enlightenment, which can be even more aggravating when his rapping isn&rsquo;t good enough to justify this.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killer Mikes lays down a garbage verse on the screechy beat of &ldquo;SPACESHIP VIEWS&rdquo; that is so bad it gives me anxiety to listen to. The lyrics are cringe and reveal the old head in Killer Mike as he raps, &ldquo;Polo tee with the bucket. Attitude still on, &lsquo;Fuck it&rsquo;". I refrain from that fuck shit. I'm all about big bucks, bitch.&rdquo; Unfortunately, Curren$y and 2 Chainz don&rsquo;t help the situation and leave Kaash Page alone as the only redeeming quality about the song. While the rest of the album is a wholesome reflection on his life, this song is just one long flex. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;skip&rdquo; that shouldn&rsquo;t have made the final track list.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it isn&rsquo;t without its flaws, <em>Michael</em> is an entire project (excluding the abomination &ldquo;SPACESHIP VIEWS&rdquo;) dedicated to the personal and intimate aspects of Killer Mike&rsquo;s life. Through the album, he allows us to glimpse behind the scenes. We see the parts of him that most rappers exclude from their projects to seem tough, hard, and emotionless. We can relate to his experiences, emotions, and feelings in a unique way that seems foreign in the modern rap era. We hear the top-notch production, real bars, and tasteful features that bring emotion to life. An album that stands out in a genre, the best rap album of 2024 goes to Killer Mike and <em>Michael</em>.</p>

									<h3>Op-ed</h3>
									<p style="text-align: center;">Sorry, Your Major is Useless</p>
									<p>Yes, your degree is probably useless, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Society tends to view liberal arts and &lsquo;soft' science degrees as less valuable than engineering or &lsquo;hard&rsquo; science degrees. We even have an idiom for these majors: &ldquo;underwater basket weaving&rdquo;. But why is this? What makes a degree, often costing well over $100,000, comparable to something as ridiculous sounding as underwater basket weaving?</p>
									<p>At one point, university was reserved for the elites of the world. Luckily this changed as hundreds of schools popped up around the country and people from all backgrounds were able to get degrees. College became a place to find yourself as a person. A place to explore different ideas and maybe even learn a bit about yourself. Today, college prices, along with the amount of student debt, are at an all-time high. The <em>Why CU Boulder</em> website page of my university, the University of Colorado Boulder, says &ldquo;College should be about you. A place to pursue your passions. To build upon your strengths. A place to chase after your goals and realize your ambitions&rdquo;. This is the problem. Our universities feel that college is the place to find yourself. This might have made sense when the price of college was relatively inexpensive, but to pay universities enormous amounts of money to &ldquo;pursue your passions&rdquo; is ridiculous.</p>
									<p>In today&rsquo;s age, where a large majority of higher paying careers require a degree, the point of college should be to gain preparation for a career in the real world. Currently, these institutions spend too much time encouraging students to venture blindly into academia. When only a negligible percentage will, why not prepare their students for careers they are more likely to pursue? The fact that students are not taught skills applicable to the real world is a large reason why some people see these degrees as &lsquo;useless&rsquo;.</p>
									<p>Engineering classes, which are often taught by faculty who have spent some time in industry, are a lot more applied than classes in other departments. Students are taught how to problem solve, think critically, and effectively use resources to accomplish tasks. They do this all while learning new topics like fluid mechanics or dynamics. The use of artificial intelligence, like ChatGPT, is often encouraged, and students are regularly allowed to use &ldquo;cheat sheets&rdquo; during exams. After all, in the real world you can use these resources, why not teach students how to use them effectively? Engineering classes are hard. To get an A, a student must put in a considerable amount of time and effort, on top of an already busy courseload. What employer wouldn&rsquo;t want a student who has worked exceptionally hard and proven themselves by obtaining a challenging degree? The topics these students learn (statics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics) aren&rsquo;t more applicable than topics from other majors. In fact, you could easily argue the opposite. The value in these degrees is a consequence of the teaching style, not the content they contain.</p>
									<p>Instructors in soft science and liberal arts often force students to memorize troves of useless information. What&rsquo;s the point in memorizing the abbreviation of amino acids when google exists? Why make students memorize minute details when they can easily reference ChatGPT for information? You are not giving your students skills that will set them up for success later down the road. Don&rsquo;t give easy assignments that guarantee the student an A. Instead, challenge these students to work hard and accomplish difficult tasks. They should gain skills that are applicable to careers, not just participation trophies for showing up every day. In the current state, biomedical engineers and chemical engineers are more competitive than biology and chemistry majors. Nearly every employer would prefer an applicant to have problem solving and critical thinking skills. Why not allow students to pursue topics that align closer with their interests while simultaneously teaching them skills that will benefit them later on?</p>
									<p>But is this thinking too shallow? Is there more to life than preparing to enter the workforce? Maybe. But at the end of the day, no matter who you are, you will someday be a member of the &ldquo;workforce&rdquo;. English teachers, biologist, construction workers, are all one cog in a giant machine that we call the Earth. A college degree should be useful enough that it allows you to be a successful cog, in a variety of different fields, not just the narrow field your degree will have printed on it. It should enable you to have more options than your ancient ancestors wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to comprehend.</p>
									<p>Instead of convincing kids to venture into enormous amounts of debt so that they can &ldquo;build upon their strengths&rdquo;, universities should increase the utility of their degree programs. Departments should make their classes more practical, more difficult, and better prepare students for a career in the real world. There is no reason that someone can justifiably call a communications degree &ldquo;useless&rdquo; when nearly every single job could benefit from people who are able to effectively communicate, and it certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable to compare the utility of communications to that of underwater basket weaving.</p>

								<h3>Personal Essay</h3>
								<p style="text-align: center;">Who is Home?</p>
								<p>After an hour and a half drive from Boulder, I found myself in a room on the campus of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. A baby-faced kid that stands out from the older engineers and scientists. There were fifteen or so tables that filled this small conference room. The brown walls and low ceilings prevented complete isolation, instead nestling me into the group. I still gravitated towards the emptiest table, where a single mustached man in his mid-thirties was beginning to greet a grey-haired man wearing a bright blue polo shirt. &ldquo;IEEE&rdquo; was printed in massive white letters on the right corner of his shirt. I introduced myself and each of the men extended their hands out for a handshake as they told me their names. The handshake, a chore that never feels right, has always been an anxiety inducing event for me. It still reminds me of when I was a little kid and would meet my dad&rsquo;s work friends. To a young boy in love with goldfish, the stakes were high. If I fucked up, they would know I was just a kid, but if I succeed, I felt like I could trick them into thinking I was somehow a grown man inside of a short skinny kid&rsquo;s body. Somehow after 15 years, I haven&rsquo;t grown at all. The stakes still feel high.</p>
								<p>The mustache-man asked what I do for work, and I tell him that I am a student at CU Boulder. He seemed surprised, but enthusiastic that I was here. I learned that he is a fighter pilot teaching at the Air Force Academy. When I was little, the only thing I ever dreamed of becoming was a fighter pilot. I&rsquo;d sit in the grocery store cart in a full flight suit and pretend that I was flying through the aisles. The older man recently retired from Oracle after working as an electrical engineer for 30 years. Five minutes later another man appeared and sat down at our table. He spoke softly with an accent that I could only guess was from the middle east. The fighter pilot acknowledged a small Lockheed Martin pin on the man&rsquo;s sport coat. I found myself feeling even younger than when I first walked in. Out of place in a new and uncomfortable environment.</p>
								<p>Being a &ldquo;brat&rdquo;, the term given to kids of military parents, the constant relocation has always left me feeling like an outsider. New and unfamiliar environments were the norm. I would walk into a new school and draw stares from the other kids. While they had known each other for years, I was some kind of foreign alien invader. It&rsquo;s a lonely feeling. I would come home from school and cry to my mom for hours. After finally making friends, I found myself in the same position again and again as we moved onto the next place. Eventually we found ourselves in a place for longer than 2 years. Now when people ask where I&rsquo;m from, I have a more concrete answer: San Antonio, Texas. &ldquo;Military City U.S.A&rdquo; greets you in large letters when you walk down the escalator to baggage claim in the airport. The hot and muggy air comes next. The city is home to thousands of kids that share a similar story. All of us found normalcy in unfamiliar and new environments.</p>
								<p>When I was preparing to move to college, I thought the transition would be easy. I was excited. After all, I had 18 years of experience moving around the country. My dumbass was completely wrong. I left for college with a packed car and my mom, a psychotic woman responsible for moving four kids across the country on multiple occasions. When the military said it was time to move, she would single-handedly make it happen. She makes shit happen. Sometimes with questionable tactics and certainly more than enough aggression. Outwardly she&rsquo;s loud and obnoxious and annoying, but for each moment of terror, there are thousands more intimate and loving &ldquo;motherly&rdquo; moments. She dropped me off at my dorm and the excitement quickly wore off. There I was, alone in my dorm, with the same feelings from my youth. As the year progressed, I didn&rsquo;t adjust as quickly as 5<sup>th</sup> grade me would have. I became depressed and felt lost. It took a long time before I learned what was missing.</p>
								<p>I blamed my condition on the dorms, having to share a room with a stranger, how different I felt from my peers. These weren&rsquo;t the problem. The circumstances were different from my previous moves. After a day of classes, I came back to an empty dorm room, not my family. Sure, I had a lot of new friends to hang out with, but they weren&rsquo;t family. I had spent summers away from home before. I lived in Kenya for a summer and in Denver for another. In both instances I lived with a family just as loud and chaotic as mine. I would come home and have my people there. I could tell them about my day while watching <em>NBC Nightly News</em> or <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>. I could joke with them and argue about everything. I didn&rsquo;t have these in the dorm.</p>
								<p>While I was in the meeting room, sitting at the table and listening to the older men discuss their careers and experiences, another retiree joined us. I immediately knew he was from Texas. His dark skin and textured face, a clear product of hours in the hot Texas sun. He talked about his career in the army. How it took him from the southern Texas heat all the way to fridged cold of Alaskan winters. He too grew up in a military family. Like me, he moved across the country multiple times. Like me, he spent most of his time in San Antonio. When I told him I was also from San Antonio. His eyes lit up. We talk for a bit longer and he eventually says, &ldquo;You know as military kids we have a strange relationship with &lsquo;home&rsquo;. You never spend long enough to say you&rsquo;re from a particular place, so &lsquo;home&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t really a place&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t visit San Antonio anymore. When I go home for Christmas or Thanksgiving we are in different places like New York or visiting another country, yet I feel perfectly at home because I am with my family. The routines we used to have, nightly shows or breakfast roast battles continue like they&rsquo;ve never stopped. We catch up on our lives and reminisce over past experiences. We argue over the same dumb shit and still get yelled at for not cleaning up or listening.</p>
								<p>After nearly four years of living in Colorado, I am preparing for the next chapter. In August I will, once again, move across the country. This time to Boston. I&rsquo;ve never been to Boston, not even on vacation. I don&rsquo;t know anyone there and I don&rsquo;t know much about the city. However, unlike my move to college, I will have family with me. My girlfriend will be moving with me to this new city. We can explore the new city together as we learn how to move and navigate in a new environment. My brother will be close by in New York, where he is attending school at The United States Military Academy, a short three-hour drive away. He&rsquo;ll be able to swing by to escape from the long and exhausting days at West Point. While a lot is still unknown, I know that it will be easier to adjust.</p>

									<h3>Interview with Dr. Heikkila</h3>
									<p>Dr. Tanya Heikkila is a professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver. She is also the co-director of CU Denver&rsquo;s Master&rsquo;s in Public Policy Program and the director of the school&rsquo;s Center for Policy and Democracy. I wanted to interview Dr. Heikkila to learn more about how public policy is researched and what questions she is looking to answer. I also wanted to understand how the field has changed since she began her career, not only in the long-term trend, but also in the last few months since the Trump administration took control of the white house.</p>
									<p>In recent years, Dr. Heikkila has focused on environmental policy and governance. She is currently working on a large interdisciplinary team, comprised of engineers, geographers, urban planners, and policy experts. Together, they research the development of climate resilient and socially equitable housing. Dr. Heikkila described different aspects of the project and gave a great example of how data is collected to better inform their research. She discussed stakeholders in urban development through different case studies and examples.</p>
									<p>I also talked to Dr. Heikkila about how environmental policy has changed throughout her career. Dr. Heikkila described how impacts in federal funding and state&rsquo;s rights, due to the Trump administration, have negatively affected environmental policy. She went in depth into how the administration has been attempting to prevent states from passing laws in favor of environmental regulation and discussed the consequences of measures like this. She also talked about how aggressive regulation, while detrimental in the short-term, could possibly fuel citizens to feel empowered towards climate related issues. This might limit the long-term impacts from the Trump administration&rsquo;s crackdown on environmental policies.</p>
