										<h2>Hi, I'm Caleb!</h2>
										<p>About me:</p>
									</header>
									<p>I’m graduating in May 2025 with a degree in Engineering Physics from the University of Colorado Boulder, along with minors in Biochemistry and Applied Mathematics. I'm naturally curious and passionate about learning across a wide variety of fields, from cutting-edge technologies to the intricate details of scientific research. Follow the links to explore some of my interests, and don’t hesitate to reach out or connect with me on LinkedIn!</p>

												<h4><a href = "https://www.mitre.org/" target ="_blank">MITRE</a>: Systems Engineering Intern</h4>
												<p> 
													I am currently an intern at MITRE, supporting projects for the U.S. Department of Defense. During my time here, I have worked on three different projects:
													<ol>
														<li>I developed a coordinate registration algorithm for high-frequency radar applications using MATLAB.</li>
														<li>I created a visualization toolkit in Python for computational fluid dynamics simulations.</li>
														<li>I am currently developing a satellite modeling tool with STK.</li>
													  </ol>
												</p>
												<p>I’m thankful for the opportunity to present one of my projects directly to our sponsors, which earned me an internal MITRE award.</p>

												<h4><a href = "https://jila.colorado.edu/" target ="_blank">JILA</a>: Research Assistant</h4>
												<p>Over the last three years, I have been building and calibrating magnetic tweezers. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tweezers" target ="_blank">Magnetic tweezers</a> are a scientific instrument used to manipulate and study biomolecules, such as DNA or proteins. They work by using an external magnetic field to exert force on superparamagnetic beads attached to the target molecules. This technique enables us to investigate mechanical properties such as elasticity and binding interactions. Our magnetic tweezers use a high-speed CMOS camera capable of tracking micron-sized particles at over 2000 frames per second. Calibration is performed by measuring the elasticity of double-stranded DNA, a well-known constant. </p>
												<p>I successfully built the instrument and have applied forces to DNA. Currently, I'm redesigning the optics to enable the application of higher forces.</p>

												<p>I spent two years tutoring NCAA Division 1 student athletes in a variety of different subjects, such as calculus, physics, and chemistry. I love watching students grow and become confident in their ability to handle difficult and challenging classes!</p>

								<h3>Hobbies</h3>
								<p>I'm a hobby collector! Here's a not-so-comprehensive list of things I love doing outside of work and school. Check back later — who knows what new obsession I'll have picked up by then!</p>

											<h4>ChemE Car</h4>
											<p>I’m the Mechanical Lead of the Chemical Engineering Car Club at CU. We design and build a small robotic car powered and stopped by chemical reactions. Each year, we travel to the regional competition—and last year, we made it to nationals! As seniors, we’re now focused on mentoring the next generation as they prepare to build their car and compete in this year’s competition.</p>

											<p>I spend most of my free time outside! I love to fly fish, hike, mountain bike, backcountry ski, climb, and everything else! </p>

											<h4>Homebrewing</h4>
											<p>I love beer and chemistry, and homebrewing lets me combine both passions! So far, I’ve crafted IPAs, amber ales, and witbiers — with a coffee stout next on the list. I'm always open to suggestions and happy to teach anyone interested in learning how to brew!</p>

											<h4>Projects</h4>
											<p>I’m always trying to learn something new! I like to build things and challenge myself my learning new skills. In this section, I’ll try to keep track of my latest projects and eventually I will turn this section into a blog that walks through my latest endeavors! </p>
											<p>Right now, I am trying to learn about SDR and RF signals. To do this, I have been messing with the RTL-SDR. You can follow along to see my progress on my github. Here is the  <a href = "https://github.com/cmaddry/CM-SDR" target ="_blank">link</a>!</p>
